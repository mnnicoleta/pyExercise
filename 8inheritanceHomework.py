# 6 Challenge:
# We have new customers for our Polygons company.
# • They need to create square objects with a certain area
# • They need a method to compute the perimeter only for triangle objects
# Requirements: * add an alternative constructor to Square class that takes the area as an argument
# and creates a square object with the apropriate sides
# Example :
# sq = Square.from_area(8)
# print(sq)
# Side 1 with lenght: 2
# Side 2 with lenght: 4
# Side 3 with lenght: 2
# Side 4 with lenght: 4
# • we want to make our perimeter method also available to other shapes in the future. Create
# a mixin class for perimeter that contains the perimeter method
