1.3 Dictionaries homework

Using data from Eurostat, create a list of tuples representing the “Self-perceived health by
country and sex, age group >16, for people living in cities” for 2017-2018. Have at least
30 values in your dataset.

The dataset will have the following struncture:
[(country, year, sex, health_index), ... ]
Example:
[(‘France’, 2017, M, 12), …]

Using only comprehensions, create the following dicts:
- two dicts that group all data by country for each year
    health_index_2017 = {‘France’: [sex, health_index]}
    health_index_2018 = {‘France’: [sex, health_index]}

- one dict that groups all data by year for Germany
    germany = {2017: [sex, health_index]}

- one dict that grups all data by country and year, by using year in the
key together with the country name
    health_index = {‘France_2017’: [year, sex, health_index]}

- starting from the previous health_index dict, display only the data where the health_index >5
- starting from the previous health_index dict, display only the data where the health_index >5 and sex is ‘F’
- starting from the previous health_index dict, create a for loop to print the health_index
